  <p>
    I'm a passionate software developer with a love for creating elegant
    solutions to complex problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me
    exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing
    my knowledge through writing and speaking.
  </p>

  <h2>What I Do</h2>
  <p>
    I specialize in full-stack development with expertise in modern web
    technologies. My current focus areas include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Frontend Development (React, Next.js, Astro, Tailwind CSS)</li>
    <li>Backend Development (PHP, Node.js)</li>
    <li>UI/UX Design (Figma, Canva)</li>
    <li>Deployment (Vercel, Netlify)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>My Journey</h2>
  <p>
    I started my programming journey over 5 years ago, and it's been an
    incredible ride ever since. From building simple websites to architecting
    complex applications, every project has taught me something valuable about
    technology and problem-solving.
  </p>

  <h2>Beyond Code</h2>
  <p>When I'm not immersed in code, I enjoy:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reading technical blogs and books</li>
    <li>Contributing to open-source projects</li>
    <li>Exploring new programming languages and frameworks</li>
    <li>Gardening</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Let's Connect</h2>
  <p>
    I'm always interested in hearing about new opportunities, interesting
    projects, or just connecting with fellow developers. Feel free to reach out
    if you'd like to collaborate on something exciting or just want to say
    hello!
